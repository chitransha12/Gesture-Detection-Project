## **ðŸ“¢ Short GitHub Description**
> **Real-Time Hand Gesture Detection** â€“ Detects Fist, Thumbs Up, Pointing, and Open Hand gestures in real time using Mediapipe and OpenCV, with live landmark drawing and gesture classification.


If you want, I can also **extend your code** to support **more gestures** like "Peace âœŒ" or "OK ðŸ‘Œ" without much effort. That would make your GitHub repo look even cooler.
